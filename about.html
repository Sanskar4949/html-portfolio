<p>Hello everyone! My name is Sanskar Kumawat, and I'm currently persuing
   my degree in Btech CSE from vit bhopal. I'm thrilled to be here today
  and to share a bit about myself with you.</p>

<p>I've always been fascinated by Computers and technology. This led me to choose this Branch.
  Through that, I discovered many new things.
  Since then, my passion has been working with computers and creating something new.
  I'm particularly interested in Web development.
  While I'm working on my goals, you might also find me doing some physical activities.
  I believe that physical activities like sports are also an important part of our life.
  I'm excited to connect with all of you and learn more about your own unique stories.
